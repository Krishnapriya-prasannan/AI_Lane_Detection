### **Day 10 - Lane Detection**  
This is part of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge.  
On **Day 10**, I implemented a basic **lane detection system** using **Computer Vision techniques** to identify road lane markings from a driving video â€” a key part of autonomous vehicle perception.

### **Goal**  
Detect lane lines from a front-facing camera feed in a driving scenario using classical CV methods like **Canny edge detection** and **Hough Transform**.

### **How It Works**

1. **Video Frame Extraction**
   - Captured individual frames from the driving video using OpenCV.

2. **Canny Edge Detection**
   - Converted frames to grayscale.
   - Applied Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
   - Used Canny edge detector to highlight lane-like edges.

3. **Region of Interest Mask**
   - Defined a polygonal mask to focus only on the region of the road (where lanes are expected).

4. **Hough Line Transform**
   - Detected straight lines in the masked edge image.
   - Separated left and right lanes based on slope and position.

5. **Lane Overlay**
   - Averaged the detected line segments for stability.
   - Overlaid the detected lanes back onto the original frame.

6. **Output Video**
   - Compiled the processed frames into an output video with highlighted lanes.

### **Highlights**

- Understood and applied **classical computer vision** concepts.
- Developed a real-time **lane detection pipeline**.
- Learned to work with **video I/O**, frame-wise processing, and overlay rendering.
- Hands-on practice with **Canny + Hough Transform combo**.
- Built a visual foundation for more advanced AI-driven self-driving tasks.
